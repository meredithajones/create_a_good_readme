## Introduction
    In this project, I utilized node js to create a template utilizing prompts to walk a user through creating a good readme document to accompany a project.
        * User Story
          As a user, I need to create a thorough and organized readme file to explain a project that I created. 
          When I begin this application by initializing node js, I am walked through a series of prompts which when 
          answered, will produce a readme document for my project.

## Technology

    javascript, node.js, and markdown.
